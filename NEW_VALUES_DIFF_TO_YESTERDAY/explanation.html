  <h3>In this plot we show the acceleration or deceleration</h3>
  <p>Some variables are calculated as differences (\(\Delta\)) from
  day before; those variables resemble the <i>speed</i> of the descripted object.
  In this plot we show the difference of differences.
  Hence, a value greater than \(0\) says that the variable is <i>accelerating</i> i.e. it is
  gaining (or losing, if it is less than zero) momentum.
  </p>
  <p>The greater the bar, the bigger the difference between today and the day before.</p>
  <p>Actually, this plot is meaningful whether a particular and constant trend
    can be identified. Oscillating values are less significative.</p>
