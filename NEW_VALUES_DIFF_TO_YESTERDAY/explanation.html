  <h3>In this plot we show the acceleration or deceleration os some variables</h3>
  <p>When we look at variables that are calculated like differences (Delta) from
  day before, those variables somehow resemble the <i>speed</i> of the
  underlying descripted object.
  In this case we plot the difference of differences.
  Hence, a value greater
  than zero says that the variable is <i>accelerating</i> i.e. it is consistently
  gaining (or losing if it is less than zero) amount.
  </p>
  <p>The greater the bar, the bigger the difference between today and the day before.</p>
  <p>Actually, this plot has a signficant meaning whether a particular and constant trend
    can be identified. Oscillating values are less significative.</p>
