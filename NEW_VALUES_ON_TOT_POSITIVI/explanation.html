  <h3>In this plot we show the day \(\Delta\) divided by the total positives number</h3>
  <p>This plot is mainly used for the calc of the factor used in FORECASTS_ON_SPEED.
    Every curve represents a value like \(\dot{x} \over {x}\) which is part of
    the common differential S-I-R model.
  </p>
  <p>The fitting curves (hidden by default) are calculated for order
    \(o(1), o(2), o(3)\);
  </p>
  <p>The plot can also be seen as a <i>growing factor</i> which represents the increment
    (or decrement) of the \(\Delta\) value compared to the overall positives.
