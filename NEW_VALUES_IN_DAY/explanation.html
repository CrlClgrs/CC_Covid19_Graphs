  <h3>In this plot we summarize the main daily values</h3>
  <p>Daily values need a bit of attention:
    the <b>positives of day</b> is the number of infected people in this day.
    This is not the difference between the infected of today and the ones of yesterday because
    this quantity is cleared of healed and deceased
    (as we can see in NEW_VALUES_STACKS).
  </p>
  <p>Here we show the positives of the day stacked with healed and deceased: this is the
    <b>total number of cases</b> of the single day.
    In fact, every day the total cases are the sum of
    people just infected plus the ones who left the desease since healed or deceased.
