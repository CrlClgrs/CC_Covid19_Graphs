  <h3>Ih this plot we summarize the main daily values</h3>
  <p>Daily values need a bit of attention for being correctly analyzed.
    Particularly, the <b>positives of day</b> is the number of people found positive today.
    This is not the difference between the positives of today and yesterday because
    this second value takes into account also healed and deceased
    (as we will better see in NEW_VALUES_STACKS).
  </p>
  <p>Here we show the positives of the day stacked with healed and deceased: this is the
    total number of cases of the single day.
    In fact, every day the total cases are the sum of
    people just infected plus the ones who left the illness since healed or deceased.
