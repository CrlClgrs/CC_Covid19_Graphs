  <h3>In this plot we consider the number of tests</h3>
  <p> \(positives \over tests\) is the ratio between the overall number of infected and the overall number of tests. This plot is also approximated with a <i>Gaussian</i> fit.
  </p>
  <p> \(daypositives \over \Delta(tests)\) is the daily rate of infected over tests. This is the more important variable to evaluate the spreading of the desease.
  </p>
  <p> \(\Delta(positives) \over \Delta(tests)\) is the ratio between the difference of infected and tests. On the other hand, this variable is quite misleading.
