  <h3>In this plot we show the real and forecasted behaviour of the main variables</h3>
  <p>Every variable in this plot is shown against its forecasted value.
  Forecasts are obtained mocking the differential S-I-R model that rules this kind of
phenomena.</p>
<p>In NEW_VALUES_ON_TOT_POSITIVI we calculated the ratio between the daily value and the total
number of positives in day. Those curves are approximated by means of a polynomial fit and that approximation
is used here to calculate the est curves.
The more suitable order of the polynomial approximation is chosen by visual inspection.
</p>
<p>The forecasts differ from the ones in ABSOLUTE_STACKS due to the different
kind of approximation.</p>
