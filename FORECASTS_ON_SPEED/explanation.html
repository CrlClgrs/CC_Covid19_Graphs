  <h3>In this plot we show the real and forecasted behaviour of the main variables</h3>
  <p>Every variable in this plot is shown against its forecasted value.
  Here, forecasts are obtained mocking the differential model underlying these kind of
phenomena. In particular we calculated the ratio between the daily value and the total
number of positives in day (plots are shown in NEW_VALUES_ON_TOT_POSITIVI). Those
curves have been approximated by means of a polynomial fit and this approximation
is used here to calculate the est curves. The more suitable order of the polynomial
approximation
is chosen by visual inspection.
</p>
<p>These forecasts differ from the ones in ABSOLUTE_STACKS due to the different
kind of approximation.</p>
