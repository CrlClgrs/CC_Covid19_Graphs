  <h3>In this plot we show the overall values</h3>
  <p>The stacks of the <b>cases</b> shows how many people have been in
    touch with the virus until the current day \((\)positives\(+\)healed\(+\)deceased\()\).
    This curve will flatten as time goes by, meaning that no new cases will be added to the stack.
    Its behaviour is approximated and forecasted with the use of a <i>Logistic</i> curve.
    The Logistic curve is calculated as integration of a <i>Gaussian</i> fitting
    the differential data (i.e. the difference of every day from the the day before).
    The same forecasting technique is used for the <b>deceased</b> curve.
  </p>
  <p>The <b>positives</b> clearly have a different behaviour: the curve goes like a
  a Gaussian itself since the infected will point to \(0\).</p>
