  <h3>Ih this plot we compare the amount of people leaving or entering the desease</h3>
  <p>In every day we have 3 quantities: the one above the \(0\) in the \(y\) axis is the
    amount of positives found in this day. Below the \(0\) we find the deceased \(+\)
    the healed. The up-stack is the stream of people incoming into the bucket of the infected;
    the down-stack is the stream of people leaving the bucket of the infected.
  </p>
  <p>When the up-stack is bigger than the the down-stack, the overall infected are decreasing.
  </p>
  <p>The above shaded plot is the difference of the two stacks i.e. the number of actual
    infected people. When the plot falls below \(0\), the infected are decreasing.
